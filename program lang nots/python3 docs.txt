THIS IS FILE ON PYTHON 3 TRICKS AND FUNCTIONS SHORTCUTS:

*)LISTCOMPREHENSION: we can use this to generate list without writing to many code , just in one line we can get the list

*)SWAPCASE() : This function swaps the case of the string that is being given , it dont take arguments 

*)len() :  to find the length of the string or list or any thing

*) TO FIND THE SECOND LARGEST DIGIT:
		z= max(lis)
		if(max(lis)==z):
			lis.remove(z)
		z=max(lis) # this is the second largest number after removing the largest and repeting number that was max.

*)join() : this is to join the values with the value given in the string for example;
		s=s.split()
		"-".join(s)
		============ this gives thee value with "-" in between the words.

*) if we want to change the string then we can use slice function or [] things eg:
		def mutate_string(string, position, character):
   			 string = string[:position]+character+string[position+1:]
   			 return string

*)eval(): this is use to evluate an expression and return the value, like we can do validations and solve
	 maths expression, it automatically understands the data type and return that type

*)any(): it returns TRUE if any item in iterable is true else return false, it also returns false if its empty
